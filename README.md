Bestsellers
===========

This is a short project I made for a class using two APIS. It uses the New York Times API to pull in the top ten bestsellers in a given category. 
Clicking on a bestseller opens a lightbox with the most popular Goodreads reviews for that book. 

The finished project is here: http://jennyandherstories.com/bestsellerReviews/

To use this code, you will need to include jquery-1.11.0.min.js in your folder.

To make the lightbox work, you will also want to use photoshop to make a 1px by 1px black semi-transparent png called overlay.png.
The lightbox is based on this tutorial:http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/super-simple-lightbox-with-css-and-jquery--webdesign-3528
